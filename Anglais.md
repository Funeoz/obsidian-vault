Our world needs a big change. Not by choice, but because it’s mandatory. In fact, we reached our peak oil production in 2008. That means that oil will be more expensive and more difficult to extract.

And I think you already know it, energy is the base to make our world and our machines function. We use machines to grow our food, move, work, and so on.

So we must move away from a world that relies on fossil energy to a world powered by cleaner energy.

And technology is here to help us with that.

So in this presentation, we will do an overview of the upcoming technologies that will make our world more efficient and more ecologically sustainable.


### New sources of energies

Let’s talk about the energies of the future because they will be the foundations of other technologies.

Obviously, the energies will have to be based on resources that are not exhaustible.

#### The sun

Firstly, we have the sun. The sun will die in 5 billion years so it is far enough to be considered renewable.

A lot of different studies are made to develop new technologies that handle the energy from the sun, which are for example photovoltaic panels.

To put the functioning in a nutshell, the photons coming from the sun hit the panel and put in movement the electrons in the silicon cells, which create electricity.

According to the ADEME, the french agency for the environment, we can produce 53GW of electricity if we put solar panels above parking and abandoned zones, which is almost the installed power of nuclear energy in 2021. So it is huge.

And one research stood out recently in favor of solar power : the efficiency of 30% in a solar panel made with silicon and perovskite was reached. To remind you, the efficiency of our actual nuclear power plants is 33%. So it is a big step forward.

#### The seas

Now let’s talk about the seas. They are the second biggest source of energy available in France.

Currently, we have different energies being developed :

- wave energy : energy based on the waves

- osmotic energy : the energy based on the difference in the salt concentration between seawater and river water

- other less used energies

But the most interesting one is offshore wind energy. This is the energy the most actively developed currently.

In fact, in 2009, the average capacity of an offshore wind turbine was 3MW. Now, the upcoming offshore wind turbine coming from the company Siemens Gamesa is expected to reach 14 MW and will be released in 2024.

To explain how it works simply, it is just a classical wind turbine that creates electricity with the rotation of the blades. But we take advantage of the stronger winds that blow in the seas.

Then we gather the energy to the land with submarine cables.

In France, it is planned to install a total capacity of 50 GW by 2050. Currently, we have 19 GW installed.

#### Nuclear power

Finally, let’s talk about the innovations in the nuclear field. Currently, two main innovations are being developed :

- New nuclear power plants based on fission

- Nuclear fusion

In the field of fission, the upcoming fast-neutron reactors will be more efficient because they will use 96% of the uranium. Therefore, it means less waste.

We also have molten salt reactors. They have three main advantages :

  - they work at higher temperatures so they are more efficient

  - they can use thorium, which is 500 times more abundant than uranium

  - they are safer because they work with lower pressure

In the field of nuclear fusion, the main project is being developed in France : the project ITER.

It is still an experimental project but it is expected to be an unlimited and sustainable source of electricity.

Production state is planned for 2035 despite important delays.
