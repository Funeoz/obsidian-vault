Imagine that, at the EFREI, you could get some cash every time you get a score of 16 out of 20, and a bonus if the score is higher. That would be a nice way to refund the tuition fees right?

Just by raising your hand, who thinks it is a good idea to give cash incentives? Who thinks we should not give cash incentives?

Well, I’m for the second option. And I will tell you why it is unfair for you, and more surprisingly, why it could put our society at risk.

While we can think that it is a good way to stimulate students into working at school, it is still unfair because it ignores the inequality of opportunity in many countries.

Let me explain.

In 2018, a study from the PISA, the Programme for International Student Assessment, compared the results in mathematics, science, and reading of students coming from 79 countries.

One statistic stood out: among the 20 first countries except one on the PISA reading test, the difference between advantaged students and disadvantaged students was near or above 60 points.

In France, this difference even reaches 107 points, which is a lot compared to Macao in China where the difference is of 31 points, the lowest of the test.

Then, you could say to me: “What distinguishes an advantaged student from a disadvantaged student ?”. Well, it’s simply an indicator based on 3 variables: parents’ level of education, parents’ highest occupational status, and home possessions, which include books. The higher it is, the more advantaged the student is.

On top of that, according to a study from Keskpaik and Rocher from 2011, if you want children to succeed at school in France, it is better that you give them books and take them to museums. Simply because in our country, it’s what we call the “cultural capital” that influences how children succeed at school.

Therefore, it’s difficult to defend a system that rewards the same students: the students that had the chance to grow up in an advantaged family.

Now, let’s take it to another level. If we are at school to learn for ourselves, how are we sure that introducing cash incentives will not replace the goal of going to school, which is going to school for the sake of learning?

In 2001, an experiment took place in Israeli daycare centers for kids. A fine was introduced to punish parents that would come late to collect their kids.

Let’s do a survey again just by raising your hand. Who thinks that fewer parents came late to collect their kids ? And who thinks that more parents came late ?

Well, the second group is right. Introducing the fine increased the number of parents coming late for their kids. And even after removing the fine, the number didn’t drop.

This means that introducing the fine crowded out the parents’ sense of responsibility. They only see it as a financial transaction.

That is why the philosopher Michael Sandel worked on this question in his book _What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets_. Do we want to, I quote,  “introduce money into a certain practice that will dissolve or displace or crowd out goods, attitudes, norms, values worth caring about“ ?

The same applies to students and their education. 

Do we really want to introduce money in a field where students must learn for themselves starting at a young age?
More globally, is it a good idea for our society to introduce market mechanisms in education, the field that builds up the sense of civic responsibility of our students ? Should we corrupt that ? 

I think the answer is pretty clear. Giving cash incentives to students that have good test scores is not fair because we still live in a society where inequalities remain. And it also raises moral issues that could be destructive of our society. Market mechanisms shouldn’t interfere in education. 

Thank you.
